  <h3>Hi, I’m Kai Cox.</h3>

  <p>If you’re here, you’ve probably been Googling eye floaters for longer than you’d like to admit.  
  So let me start by saying: <strong>I get it.</strong></p>

  <p>I’ve been where you are.</p>

  <p>I know what it’s like to look up at the sky and immediately feel your stomach drop.  
  To stare at a white wall and feel a wave of anxiety rush in.  
  To obsess over squiggly shadows that drift through your vision like uninvited guests you just can’t tune out.</p>

  <p>For years, floaters dominated my focus. I tried everything — forums, supplements, eye exercises, tinted glasses, even considering surgery. I wanted relief. I wanted answers.  
  But mostly, I wanted to feel normal again.</p>

  <p>And that’s where this journey really began.</p>

  <h2>A Bit of Backstory</h2>
  <p>I first noticed floaters as a teenager. I was nearsighted, and like so many others, I assumed what I was seeing was temporary. But they didn’t go away. They became louder, more intrusive, more persistent — not just in my field of vision, but in my mind.</p>

  <p>They followed me into adulthood, through work, relationships, and major life changes. Sometimes I’d go days without thinking about them. Other times, they’d pull me into an obsessive loop — checking, scanning, panicking, searching.</p>

  <p>It wasn’t until I began studying the <strong>brain</strong>, not just the <strong>eyes</strong>, that things started to change.</p>

  <h2>From Research to Recovery</h2>
  <p>I’m not a doctor or a therapist. I’m a writer, a developer, and someone who became deeply curious about why some people suffer so much from floaters — while others barely notice them.</p>

  <p>I started diving into neuroscience.<br>
  I learned about <strong>neuroplasticity</strong> — the brain’s ability to change how it processes sensory input.<br>
  I studied the connection between <strong>attention and anxiety</strong>, between <strong>fear and fixation</strong>.<br>
  I experimented on myself: meditation, desensitization, cognitive behavioral techniques, attention redirecting.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The floaters were still there.<br>
    But I stopped noticing them.<br>
    Or rather, my brain stopped caring.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This shift didn’t happen overnight. But it was real. And it stuck.</p>

  <h2>Why I Wrote <em>Forget Floaters</em></h2>
  <p>I created this site and wrote <em>Forget Floaters</em> because I wanted to give others the guide I wish I had when I was struggling.</p>

  <p>I don’t promise miracle cures.<br>
  I don’t hype surgery.<br>
  I don’t minimize your experience by saying “just ignore it.”</p>

  <p>Instead, I walk with you through a different approach — one that focuses on the <strong>mental loop</strong> that keeps floaters front and center, and how to break it.</p>

  <p>My book is a practical, science-backed roadmap for retraining your brain and reclaiming your peace — even if the floaters never go away.</p>

  <h2>A Bit More About Me (Beyond Floaters)</h2>
  <p>When I’m not writing or building digital tools, I’m usually doing things that keep me grounded:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading psychology and philosophy</li>
    <li>Learning about perception and human behavior</li>
    <li>Sitting outside and <em>intentionally</em> looking at the sky</li>
    <li>Reminding myself — and others — that not everything needs to be perfect to be peaceful</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I write under the name <strong>Kai Cox</strong>, but the person behind that name is just a regular human being who spent years figuring this out the hard way… so maybe you don’t have to.</p>

  <h2>Let’s Keep Going</h2>
  <p>This site exists for two reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>To help you understand that what you’re experiencing is real</li>
    <li>To show you that <strong>you are not powerless</strong> against it</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can’t always control what you see.<br>
  But you <em>can</em> control what you <strong>focus on</strong>.</p>

  <p>Thanks for being here.<br>
  Keep moving forward — gently, consistently, and with your attention where it belongs.</p>
