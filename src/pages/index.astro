    <h2>👁 Floaters Driving You Nuts?</h2>
    <p>
      If you've ever found yourself blinking at blue skies or white screens trying to "clear away" those pesky dots, strings, and shadowy shapes in your vision... you're not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eye floaters are frustrating, distracting, and for many people, <strong>life-altering</strong>. Worse still? You're told there's no real fix — other than dangerous surgery, or "just get used to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if getting used to it wasn’t a defeat... <br />
      What if it was the <em>secret weapon</em>?

<h2>📘 Inside You'll Learn:</h2>

<h2>✍️ Why I Wrote This Book</h2>
<p>
  I’ve lived with eye floaters for nearly two decades. They first showed up in high school — distracting me in class, during conversations, and in nearly every quiet moment. I tried everything.
</p>
<p>
  Over time, I didn’t just <em>cope</em> — I <em>beat them</em>.<br />
  I trained my brain to tune them out almost entirely. Today, I go hours — even days — without noticing them at all.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I want to show you how to do the same.
</p>
