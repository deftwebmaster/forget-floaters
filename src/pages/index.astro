<h2>👁 Tired of Staring Through a Snow Globe?</h2>
<p>
  If you've ever found yourself blinking at blue skies or white screens trying to "clear away" those pesky dots, strings, and shadowy shapes in your vision... you're not alone.
</p>
<p>
  Eye floaters are frustrating, distracting, and for many people, <strong>life-altering</strong>. Worse still? You're told there's no real fix — other than dangerous surgery, or "just get used to it."
</p>
<p>
  But what if getting used to it wasn’t a defeat... <br />
  What if it was the <em>secret weapon</em>?
</p>

<h2>🔥 This Book is Your Brain’s Reset Button</h2>
<p>
  In <em>Forget Floaters</em>, you'll discover a surprisingly effective, science-backed method to <strong>train your brain to ignore floaters</strong> — to the point where they no longer disrupt your focus, mood, or peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
  This isn't about wishful thinking.<br />
  It's about <strong>reclaiming control</strong> of your visual world — naturally.
</p>

<h2>📘 Inside You'll Learn:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Why floaters feel more intrusive than they are — and how to break that loop</li>
  <li>The powerful technique that reprograms your attention (and how I used it daily)</li>
  <li>How to design your environment to retrain your perception</li>
  <li>The mental shifts that turn frustration into freedom</li>
  <li>A 7-day starter plan to kick off your floater fade-out journey</li>
</ul>

<h2>✍️ Why I Wrote This Book</h2>
<p>
  I’ve lived with eye floaters for nearly two decades. They first showed up in high school — distracting me in class, during conversations, and in nearly every quiet moment. I tried everything.
</p>
<p>
  Over time, I didn’t just <em>cope</em> — I <em>beat them</em>.<br />
  I trained my brain to tune them out almost entirely. Today, I go hours — even days — without noticing them at all.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I want to show you how to do the same.
</p>
