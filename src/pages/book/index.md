### 👁 Tired of Staring Through a Snow Globe?

If you've ever found yourself blinking at blue skies or white screens trying to "clear away" those pesky dots, strings, and shadowy shapes in your vision... you're not alone.

Eye floaters are frustrating, distracting, and for many people, **life-altering**. Worse still? You're told there's no real fix — other than dangerous surgery, or "just get used to it."

But what if getting used to it wasn’t a defeat...  
What if it was the *secret weapon*?

### ✍️ Why I Wrote This Book

I’ve lived with eye floaters for nearly two decades. They first showed up in high school — distracting me in class, during conversations, and in nearly every quiet moment. I tried everything.

Over time, I didn’t just *cope* — I *beat them*.  
I trained my brain to tune them out almost entirely. Today, I go hours — even days — without noticing them at all.

Now, I want to show you how to do the same.
